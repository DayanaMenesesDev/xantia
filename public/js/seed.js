With a Ltd company you get the same rights as a limited company, but you don't have to tie up 50,000 SEK in share capital. Instead, the share capital in England is only 1 GBP or optionally a higher share capital. It is not without reason that Ltd companies are today Sweden's fastest growing company form. Ltd companies give you the advantages and freedom of a limited company but at the cost of a sole proprietorship. Ltd companies are a secure company form. Registration is done by first establishing an English limited company (Ltd) in England and then, if you want, registering a Swedish branch (SUF) of this company with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. You do not need to have any operations in the English Ltd company, but it can be a parent company if you only conduct business in Sweden with an optional Swedish branch.",

A Swedish branch (SUF) functions just like a Swedish limited company and has the same rights and obligations. You can apply for an F-tax slip and VAT and be an employer in the Swedish branch. Employ yourself according to current laws and you only pay tax in Sweden for the Swedish branch. This means that the Swedish branch reports VAT and pays tax just like a regular Swedish limited company. When the Swedish branch is registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office, which takes about 7 days, the company can immediately start its operations. Our Customer Service is open every day of the year via email for free consultation.",
